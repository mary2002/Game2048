# Game2048
This game is written in console environment.It compiles by gcc compiler.It's just for practice.
           ----------------------------------------------------
The steps of project:
1.I created header file for definitions in projects.
2.I need a matrix to show the number and play game,so the first I declares one matrix (4in4) and filled all matrix by zero.
4.I need a random number between 0 and 3 because of the index of matrix, so I used rand() function and calculated the remainder is divided into four becuase is created ranbom number betwean 0 and 3, and I took ranbom number in index of two matrix houses and put values 2 in them for starting game.
3.I printed matrix.
